# Day 5 (MLOps for Generative AI)

Welcome to Day 5.

Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.

## Day 5 Assignments:

1. Complete Unit 5: “MLOps for Generative AI”, which is:
    - [Optional] Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/k9S6IhiUUj4) for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
    - Read the “[MLOps for Generative AI](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-operationalizing-generative-ai-on-vertex-ai-using-mlops)” whitepaper.
    - No code lab for today! We will do a code walkthrough and live demo of [goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack](https://goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack), a resource created for making MLOps for Gen AI easier and accelerating the path to production. Please go through the repository in advance.

2. Watch the YouTube [livestream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCFW0i9xrBc&list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es&index=5).

### Bonus Assignment

There's more!

This [bonus notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/bonus-day-extra-api-features-to-try/) walks you through a few more things you can do with the Gemini API that weren't covered during the course. This material doesn't pair with the whitepapers or podcast, but covers some extra capabilities you might find useful when building Gemini API powered apps.
