# Day 4 (Domain-Specific LLMs)

Welcome to Day 4.

In today’s reading, you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

In the code labs, you will learn how to add real-world data to a model beyond its knowledge cut-off by grounding with Google Search. You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.

## Day 4 Assignments:

1. Complete Unit 4: “Domain-Specific LLMs”:
    - [Optional] Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/b1a4ZOQ8XdI) for this unit (created by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)).
    - Read the “[Solving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-solving-domains-specific-problems-using-llms)” whitepaper.
    - Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
      1. [Use](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding) Google Search data in generation
      2. [Tune](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model) a Gemini model for a custom task
2. Watch the YouTube [livestream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odvuLMJWUSU&list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es&index=4). Paige Bailey will be joined by expert speakers from Google - Scott Coull, Antonio Gulli, Anant Nawalgaria, Christopher Semturs, and Umesh Shankar to discuss domain-specific models.
