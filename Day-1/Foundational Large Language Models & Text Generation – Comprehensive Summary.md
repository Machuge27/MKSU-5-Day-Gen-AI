## **2. Transformer Architecture & Core Components**
The **transformer** model, introduced in 2017, serves as the foundation for modern LLMs. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process entire sequences in parallel, making them highly efficient.

### **Key Components of Transformers:**
1. **Self-Attention & Multi-Head Attention**  
   - Allows the model to focus on relevant words in a sentence, improving contextual understanding.  
   - Multi-head attention enables multiple perspectives on the same data, enhancing performance.

2. **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**  
   - Helps stabilize training and improve gradient flow.

3. **Feedforward Layers**  
   - Adds non-linearity and complexity, allowing better feature extraction.

4. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**  
   - **Encoders** process input sequences into vector representations.  
   - **Decoders** generate output sequences based on encoded information.  
   - Some LLMs use only decoders (GPT series), while others use only encoders (BERT).

### **Training Transformers**
- **Data Preparation**: Text is tokenized and processed into embeddings.  
- **Training Loss Functions**: Cross-entropy loss is commonly used to improve accuracy.  
- **Context Length**: Determines how many previous tokens the model "remembers" while generating text.

## **3. Evolution of Transformer-Based Models**
Over time, LLMs have grown in size and capability. Below are key milestones:

### **GPT Series (OpenAI)**
- **GPT-1 (2018)**: Introduced unsupervised pre-training for text generation.  
- **GPT-2 (2019)**: 1.5B parameters, improved text coherence, introduced zero-shot learning.  
- **GPT-3 (2020)**: 175B parameters, excelled at few-shot learning without fine-tuning.  
- **GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 (2023-24)**: Better reasoning, multimodal capabilities (image + text processing).

### **Other Notable Models**
- **BERT (2019)**: Focused on bidirectional understanding, great for NLP tasks like classification.  
- **LaMDA (2021, Google)**: Specialized in open-ended conversations.  
- **Gopher (2021, DeepMind)**: 280B parameters, optimized dataset quality.  
- **Chinchilla (2022, DeepMind)**: Showed that **data size** matters as much as model size.  
- **PaLM & PaLM 2 (2022-23, Google)**: Pushed performance on reasoning and code generation.  
- **Gemini (2023-24, Google)**: **Multimodal** AI, processes text, images, audio, and video.  

### **Open-Source Models**
- **LLaMA (Meta AI)**: Open LLM family (7B-70B parameters).  
- **Mixtral (Mistral AI)**: Mixture-of-Experts model for efficiency.  
- **Gemma (Google AI)**: Lightweight, efficient open-source models.

## **4. Fine-Tuning Large Language Models**
LLMs can be adapted for specific tasks through fine-tuning:

### **(A) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
- Uses labeled datasets to refine an LLM’s behavior.
- Helps improve instruction-following and domain-specific performance.

### **(B) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
- **Aligns model responses** with human preferences (e.g., reducing toxicity).
- Uses human-rated responses to train a **reward model**, which then refines the LLM.

### **(C) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**
Reduces computational costs by updating only small parts of the model.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Freezes most of the model and updates only a small matrix.  
- **Adapters**: Adds small trainable modules instead of modifying the full model.  
- **Soft Prompting**: Uses learnable prompt embeddings to steer model behavior.

## **5. Using LLMs: Prompt Engineering & Sampling Techniques**
Prompting strategies significantly affect LLM outputs:

### **Prompt Engineering Techniques**
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Directly asking the model a question without examples.  
- **Few-shot prompting**: Providing a few examples to improve output quality.  
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Encourages step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

### **Sampling Techniques for Output Generation**
1. **Greedy Search** – Always picks the highest-probability word (low creativity).  
2. **Temperature Scaling** – Adjusts randomness; high values make responses more diverse.  
3. **Top-K Sampling** – Selects from the top K most likely words.  
4. **Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling** – Dynamically adjusts the selection pool for more controlled randomness.

## **6. Accelerating Inference: Making LLMs Faster & More Efficient**
LLMs require significant computational resources. Several optimization techniques help balance **cost, speed, and accuracy**.

### **Trade-Offs in Inference Optimization**
- **Quality vs. Latency/Cost**: Smaller models or quantization can improve speed but may reduce accuracy.  
- **Latency vs. Cost**: More parallelization reduces inference time but may increase infrastructure costs.

### **Optimization Techniques**
#### **(A) Output-Approximating Methods**
1. **Quantization**: Reduces precision of model weights (e.g., 32-bit → 8-bit), improving speed and memory efficiency.  
2. **Distillation**: Trains a smaller "student" model using outputs from a large "teacher" model.

#### **(B) Output-Preserving Methods**
1. **Flash Attention**: Optimizes attention computation for faster processing.  
2. **Prefix Caching**: Stores parts of previous computations to reuse in future queries.  
3. **Speculative Decoding**: Generates multiple possible outputs and quickly eliminates incorrect ones.  
4. **Batching & Parallelization**: Processes multiple user queries simultaneously to increase throughput.
