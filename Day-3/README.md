### Day 3 (Generative Agents)

Welcome to Day 3.

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.

### Day 3 Assignments:

1. Complete Unit 3: “Generative Agents”, which includes:
    - [Optional] Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/H4gZd4BCrDQ) for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
    - Read the “[Generative AI Agents](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents)” whitepaper.
    - [Optional] Read a [case study](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/regnology-automates-ticket-to-code-with-genai-on-vertex-ai?e=48754805) which talks about how a leading technology regulatory reporting solutions provider used an agentic generative AI system to automate ticket-to-code creation in software development, achieving a 2.5x productivity boost.
    - Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
      1. [Talk](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api) to a database with function calling
      2. [Build](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-3-building-an-agent-with-langgraph/) an agentic ordering system in LangGraph
